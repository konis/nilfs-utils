	* fix a bug of a nilfs library function leading to the cleanerd
	  failure on mount.  The bug typically arises when the mount
	  directory path ends with a slash symbol.  This was caused by a
	  lack of pathname canonicalization on the argument.
	* fix the problem that lssu didn't display segments properly
	  when the number of segments was specified with -n option.

	* clean up sketch file.

nilfs-utils-2.0.3  Thu May 22, 2008 JST

	* fix the problem of 'make dist-bzip2' that it produces a tarball
	  without man pages.  This fixes it by using dist_man_MANS instead
	  of man_MANS.  This release is equivalent to the previous release
	  for the rest.

nilfs-utils-2.0.2  Tue May 20, 2008 JST

	* add man pages for nilfs2 and its utilities.
	* move declaration of nilfs_persistent_group_desc struct into the
	  nilfs_fs.h file.  This structure defines on-disk format of ifile

	* Fixed a hang problem that arose under a near disk full condition.
	* Fixed the problem that a NILFS partition mounted at boot time could
	  not be unmounted manually.  This problem came from the standard
	  behavior of most Linux distributions where the /var/run directory was
	  cleaned after a boot time mount process.  The clean-up job removed
	  the PID file of cleanerd and caused its shutdown failure.
	  The cleanerd and mount/umount programs were fairly changed for this
	  fix; now /etc/mtab is used instead to keep a PID of the cleanerd.

nilfs-utils-2.0.0-testing-8  Thu Dec 27, 2007 JST

nilfs-utils-2.0.0-testing-7  Thu Nov 29, 2007 JST

	  that occurs on some distros.

nilfs-utils-2.0.0-testing-3  Tue Jul 24, 2007 JST

	* Allow regular files to be used with mkfs.nilfs2.
	  
	  The current implementation of mkfs.nilfs2 is limited to block devices
	  only, because of the use of the BLKGETSIZE64 ioctl(). That patches
	  allows mkfs.nilfs2 to format regular files, in addition to block
	  devices.
	  
	  Signed-off-by: Thomas Petazzoni <thomas.petazzoni@enix.org>
